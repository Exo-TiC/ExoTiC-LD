Installation
============

There is only one step (as of v3.2.0) for installing ExoTiC-LD.

 1) Using **python>=3.8**, install the package with pip:

    ::

       pip install exotic-ld

And now you are ready to go. Stellar models and instrument throughput data
are selected and downloaded automatically at runtime, *or custom files can
be input by the user*. These data are saved locally and so are only downloaded
once, speeding up subsequent runs. Head straight to the :doc:`quick start <quick_start>`
page to begin computing limb-darkening coefficients ðŸš€.

**Backwards compatibility/optional step:**

Prior to v3.2.0, the stellar models and instrument data had to be downloaded
manually. If you wish to not rely on an internet connection or you already
have these data, then you can proceed with step 2, which remains supported.
However this is no longer necessary, you can skip this step and start computing
limb-darkening coefficients right away.

 2) Download the stellar models and instrument throughputs from
    `this zenodo link <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7874921>`_.

    The downloaded and unzipped directory structure should have the following
    layout:

    ::

        exotic_ld_data/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Sensitivity_files/
        â”œâ”€â”€ kurucz/
        â”œâ”€â”€ stagger/
        â”œâ”€â”€ mps1/
        â”œâ”€â”€ mps2/

    Some of the stellar grids are very large in size, and so you can choose to
    download only the stellar grids that you require. The instrument throughputs
    directory, "Sensitivity_files", must always be included.

    You can place the downloaded directory anywhere on your machine, you'll
    just need to pass the path, "path/to/exotic_ld_data", as an input when
    running the code.

**Installing from source:**

Alternatively, you may install ExoTiC-LD from source. This is option is primarily
useful for those wishing to contribute to the project. The project can be cloned
from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Exo-TiC/ExoTiC-LD>`_, or your
own fork.

    ::

       git clone https://github.com/Exo-TiC/ExoTiC-LD.git

Next, navigate into the root directory of the package and install

    ::

       pip install .

For running the unit tests, again, navigate into the root directory of the package
and run

    ::

       python -m unittest tests/test_stellar_models_framework.py
       python -m unittest tests/test_ld_computation.py
